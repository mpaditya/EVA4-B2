This is the second notebook/experiment for the S5 Assignment Solution. In this notebook, we have added Max Pooling and (1X1) Conv Blocks to previous model.

### Target

Use Image Augmentation to improve test accuracy further. Also, use LR Scheduler to fasten up convergence (quickly lower loss and improve accuracy).

Keep the model & architecture same as previous Notebook.

### Results

Total Parameters: 9910

Best Training Accuracy: 98.94

Best Test Accuracy: 99.37

### Analysis

Model's test and training accuracy have not changed much.
